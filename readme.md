# Housing and Health Data Analysis

This repository contains the analysis conducted as part of my Master's dissertation at the University of South Wales under the supervision of Dr. Andrew Ware and Dr. Andrew Nelson. The project explores the relationship between housing tenure (social vs. non-social housing) and health outcomes.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains data used for analysis (if shareable, otherwise link to external data source).
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter Notebooks documenting each step of the analysis, including OLS regression, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Cox Proportional Hazards models.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts used for data cleaning, processing, and model implementation.
- **figures/**: Visualizations including graphs of hospital admissions, survival analysis, and mortality rates.
- **results/**: Key findings and summary reports.
  
## Analysis Summary
The research analyzed 492,245 records of health and housing data to investigate disparities in hospitalization rates, chronic conditions, and mortality between social and non-social housing populations. The analysis revealed higher hospitalization and mortality rates for social housing residents, particularly for respiratory and chronic diseases.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Cox Proportional Hazards Model, Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis, OLS Regression
